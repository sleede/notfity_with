# Wupee

Wupee is a simple gem which tries to fill the gap of lacking gems to manage **notifications** in Rails app.
Wupee is a opinionated solution which assumes that users needs to:

* be able to receive notifications in the app
* be able to receive notifications by email
* be able to configure if they wants to either receive emails AND notifications or emails or only notifications or nothing


The main object of the solution is the `Wupee::Notification` which stores:
* receiver (polymorphic): the recipient of the message
* attached_object (polymorphic): the subject of the notification
* notification_type_id: a reference to a `Wupee::NotificationType` object
* is_read: boolean


## Install:

To use it, add it to your Gemfile:
```ruby
gem 'wupee'
```

and bundle:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Run the generator, install migrations and migrate:

```bash
$ rails g wupee:install
$ rake wupee:install:migrations
$ rake db:migrate
```

Running the generator will do a few things:

1. add the engine routes to your routes.rb:

  ```ruby
  # config/routes.rb
  mount Wupee::Engine, at: "/wupee"
  ```
2. create wupee initializer:

  ```ruby
  # config/initializers/wupee.rb
  Wupee.mailer = NotificationsMailer # the class of the mailer you will use to send the emails
  Wupee.deliver_when = :now # use :later if you already configured a queuing system
  Wupee.receivers = 'User' # class name of your notification receivers
            # enable callbacks to create Wupee::NotificationTypeConfiguration object of
            # each user when you create a new Wupee::NotificationType
  ```
3. create a mailer `NotificationsMailer` which inheritates from `Wupee::NotificationsMailer`

  ```ruby
  # app/mailers/notifications_mailer.rb
  class NotificationsMailer < Wupee::NotificationsMailer
    default from: 'contact@sleede.com'
    layout false
 end
  ```

4. adds wupee to your locale yml file (for email subjects)
  ```yml
  # config/locales/en.yml
  en:
    wupee:
      email_subjects:
  ```

## Getting started:

### Generate a new notification type

```bash
rails g wupee:notification_type user_has_been_created
```

Will execute a few things:

1. add an entry to your locale yml file :

 ```yml
 en:
   wupee:
     email_subjects:
       user_has_been_created: "user_has_been_created"
 ```
 Feel free to edit the subject, you can put variables, example
 ```yml
  ...
      user_has_been_created: "New user created: %{user_full_name}"
 ```

2. create a json template for the notification:

 ```ruby
 json.subject ""
 json.body ""
 json.url ""
 # none of this json attribute are mandatory!
 ```
 In this template, you have access to the **notification** variable.
 You can customize it to fit your need, this is just an example.

3. create an empty html template for the notification:
 ```html
 <!-- app/views/wupee/notifications/_user_has_been_created.html.erb -->
 ```

4. You will have to create your email template as the generator doesn't create it.
 For example, if your mailer is named `NotificationsMailer`, your template will take place in
 `app/views/notifications_mailer/user_has_been_created.html.erb`

### Understand the Wupee::NotificationTypeConfiguration model

An object of the class `Wupee::NotificationTypeConfiguration` references/stores:
* receiver (polymorphic)
* notification_type (object of class `Wupee::NotificationType`)
* value (an enum)

The attribute **value** can be:
* 'both' : the receiver wants notifications **AND** emails of the `Wupee::NotificationType` type (default value)
* 'nothing' : the receiver doesn't want to receive **nothing** from the `Wupee::NotificationType` type
* 'email' : the receiver wants to receive **only** emails
* 'notification' : the receiver wants to receive **only** notifications

Just let the user edit this object to make him able to activate/deactivate notifications or emails.

### Use the concerns

#### Wupee::Receiver

Including the concern `Wupee::Receiver` in your receiver class (probably the `User` class) permits a few things:
 * get notifications of a user: `@user.notifications`
 * get notifications_type_configurations of a user: `@user.notifications_type_configurations`
 * execute an after_create callback to create `Wupee::NotificationTypeConfiguration` for each `Wupee::NotificationType` object for the receiver
 * destroy `Wupee::Notification` and `Wupee::NotificationTypeConfiguration` associated to the receiver from db if it is destroyed

#### Wupee::AttachedObject

Including the concern `Wupee::AttachedObject` in your attached object classe(s) permits a few things:
 * get notifications associated to an attached object: `@attached_object.notifications_as_attached_object`
 * destroy `Wupee::Notification` associated to the attached object if it is destroyed

### Use the DSL to send notifications

Imagine that you want to notify all admin that a new user signed up in your app and that you have a scope `admin` in your `User` class.

```ruby
 Wupee.notify do |n|
   n.attached_object @the_new_user
   n.notif_type :user_has_been_created # you can also pass an instance of a Wupee::NotificationType class to this method
   n.subject_vars user_full_name: Proc.new { |notification| notification.attached_object.full_name } # variables to be interpolated the fill in the subject of the email (obviously optional)
   n.locals extra_data: "something" # extra_data will be accessible in template as @locals[:extra_data]
   n.receivers User.admin # you can use the method receiver instead of receivers for clarity if you pass only one instance of a receiver
   n.deliver :now # you can overwrite global configuration here, optional
 end
```

You can also use the method `notify` this way:

```ruby
 Wupee.notify attached_object: @the_new_user, notif_type: :user_has_been_created, subject_vars: { user_full_name: Proc.new { |notification| notification.attached_object.full_name } }, locals: { extra_data: "Yeahhhhh" }, receivers: User.admin
```

The method will take care to check receiver's configurations to only send emails to those who want them.

### Rake tasks

#### generate Wupee::NotificationTypeConfiguration objects for given Wupee::NotificationType name and for all receivers of given class (default to User)

Example for a Wupee::NotificationType named 'user_destroyed':
```bash
rake 'wupee:generate_notification_type_configurations[user_destroyed]' # for User class
rake 'wupee:generate_notification_type_configurations[user_destroyed,Admin]' # for Admin class
```

## Wupee::Api::NotificationsController

In order to make this controller work, you need a method `current_user` which return the user currently signed in.

The controller have various actions all scoped for the current user:
 * `wupee/api/notifications#index` : fetch notifications, take an optional parameter `is_read` (false by default)
 * `wupee/api/notifications#show` : fetch a notification
 * `wupee/api/notifications#update` : mark as read a notification
 * `wupee/api/notifications#update_all` : mark as read all notifications

## Wupee::NotificationTypeConfiguration

The class also define 2 methods which you could use (in your views for example):
 * `wants_email?` : return a boolean
 * `wants_notification?` : return a boolean

## Important to know!

The system relies on the fact that you have an object in db for each couple of [receiver, `Wupee::NotificationType`]. Even if the gem provides callbacks to take care of that, be sure that those objects are created otherwise notifications won't be sent for thoses receivers.
